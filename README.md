You can use the data provided inside `resources/countryData.json` file.


### Task 1:

Your task is to create a search box which which gives all possible suggestions -> when given some inital text in the given search box. Like shown below:

Use `hooks` to manage states.

### Task 2:

As shown in the above reference gif, when we press `escape` key, the dropdown hides. You have to implement the same: when you press `escape` key -> the suggestions should not be visible.

Happy Coding ❤️!
